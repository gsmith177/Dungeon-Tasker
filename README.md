This is a basic dnd compation app that will do the following:

1: Have integrated controlls for music (uses spotify to shuffle playlists for combat, puzzles, and exploration)

2: Have all the dnd 5e rules (the players handbook, monster manual, and dungen master’s handbook) and make them searchable with an existing ai pipeline. For example, i could ask the ai “how does damage work?” and it can search the three texts and respond with the rules and an explanation of how they work.

3: encounter builder- a way for me to build combat encounters and puzzles on the fly, automatically comes up with random encounters that are leveled properly for the party.

4: a way to record audio so i can review and recap previous sessions.

5: ai text generated from recordings (an easy way to search for specific parts of the recording). For example, i can go to the recording and search for the word “cave” and any time any member of the party said “cave” it would be highlighted.

6. Story management, an easy way to manage major plot points of the story and display them.

7. a widget format- a customizable layout that can be altered based on what is needed. I want this to work similarly to the way windows allows users to create multiple desktops for different situations. I want to make one layout for combat, one for story telling and npc interaction, and one for puzzles.


To run the app, first install python (version 3.12.10), then run the following commands in the terminal (on windows):

```
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```
